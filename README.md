# Overview

Onion Task is a web app built to make team collaboration easier. Users can create projects, add collaborators, and assign tasks. The true power of Onion Task is that allows the user to work in multiple projects that are linked to each other with a one to many relationship.

If you would like to run the software, you will need to install dependencies first with `npm install` from within Onion Task terminal directory, then run `npm start`. If you do not have `npm` installed, you may need to install [Node.js](nodejs.org).

If `npm start` does not open a window, you can access the website while it is running here: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
